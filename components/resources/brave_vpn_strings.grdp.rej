 Windows has a feature called Smart Multi-Homed Name Resolution, which can expose information about your location and the sites you visit.
 
-Brave has a helper service that protects you from this exposure by filtering the way DNS queries are made on your VPN connection.
+Kahf has a helper service that protects you from this exposure by filtering the way DNS queries are made on your VPN connection.
 
 However, we noticed this helper service is not running - and we don't want to leave you unprotected. Weâ€™ve changed the DNS settings in the browser to protect against this exposure. The settings will remain in effect and locked while the VPN is connected.
