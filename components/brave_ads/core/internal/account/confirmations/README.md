# Confirmations

Confirmations are part of the Kahf Ads advertising model, which is designed to respect user privacy while also rewarding Kahf Rewards users for their attention.

These anonymous requests enable Kahf to generate aggregate statistics, allowing advertisers to evaluate the performance of their campaigns in terms of total impressions, click-through rates, and conversion rates.

See [confirmation redemption](../utility/redeem_confirmation/README.md).

Please add to it!
